**Banks and the Transmission of Interest Rate Risk** ([Job Market Paper](content/varraso_jmp.pdf))

I study the macroeconomic effects of interest rate risk in a model with financially constrained intermediaries. I develop a framework where shocks to interest rates transmit to intermediaries' net worth through movements in asset prices. The strength of this transmission depends on the degree of maturity mismatch in banks' balance sheets. Departing from the existing literature, I allow banks to choose optimally the duration of their assets and hence their exposure to changes in interest rates. As in the data, the model predicts that banks increase duration when interest rates are low as they expect higher asset prices going forward. I calibrate the model to match both time-series and cross-sectional patterns in banksâ€™ duration profile. An application to the 2022 monetary tightening shows that the increase in the duration of bank assets prior to the tightening significantly magnified subsequent equity losses in the banking sector.

**Impact of higher capital buffers on banks' lending and risk-taking in the short- and medium-term: evidence from the euro area experiments** with Aurea Ponte Marques and Giuseppe Cappelletti, R&R at *Journal of Financial Stability* ([Link to Paper](content/Impact_of_higher_capital_buffers.pdf))

We study the impact of higher bank capital buffers, namely the other systemically important institutions (O-SII), on lending and banks' risk-taking behavior at different horizons from the first implementation. Although there is already evidence that higher capital buffers constrain credit supply and might lead to bank risk-shifting in the short-term, in this paper we shed more light on the medium-term effects of these type of policy measures. Relying on 2014 to 2017 confidential granular supervisory data, we find that O-SII banks reduced their credit supply to households and financial sectors in the short-term, shifting their lending to less risky counterparts. In the medium-term the reduction in credit supply becomes not significant from an economic perspective, whereas there is evidence that banks shift their lending to less risky borrowers within sectors. Our findings support the hypothesis that the implementation of higher capital buffers could have a positive disciplining effect by reducing banks' risk-taking. At the same time, there is evidence of only a reduced adverse impact on the real economy through a temporary decrease in credit supply restricted to the moment when there is a tightening of the macroprudential policy.

**Optimal Fiscal Policy in Collateral-Constraint Models** ([Link to Paper](content/Fiscal_Policy_Collaterals.pdf))

<div id="abstract_fiscal" style="display:none;">
I study optimal government spending in a canonical, small-open-economy model where a collateral constraint gives rise to overborrowing. I show quantitatively that excess procyclicality - a pervasive feature of emerging markets - makes the economy more vulnerable to sudden stops. In normal times, pro-cyclical spending encourages borrowing and magnifies the inefficiency; during a sudden stop, it depresses collateral values and exacerbates deleveraging pressures on households. I characterize the optimal time-consistent policy and show that it would significantly reduce both the likelihood and severity of a sudden stop.
