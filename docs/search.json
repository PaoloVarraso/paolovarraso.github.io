I develop a quantitative model where banks can invest in assets of different durations and choose optimally their exposure to interest-rate fluctuations. I embed this portfolio problem in a heterogeneous-banks framework with financial frictions and endogenous default. The model predicts that in periods of loose monetary policy banks face weaker financial constraints. As a result, they become more tolerant of interest-rate risk and invest more extensively in long-duration assets. However, when the economy undergoes a sudden monetary tightening, this portfolio shift amplifies contractions in asset prices, credit, and output. I validate the model by showing that it can reproduce aggregate and cross-sectional patterns related to banks’ maturity mismatches, the level of the interest rate and leverage. A quantitative application to the 2022 monetary tightening shows that a lengthening of duration in periods of low interest rates gives rise to significant financial amplification. A liquidity requirement that restricts banks’ investment in long-term assets makes the economy less vulnerable to sudden interest-rate raises.\r\n\r\n\r\nSovereign Debt, Domestic Banks and the Provision of Public Liquidity, with Diego Perez (Link to Paper) Reject & Resubmit at Review of Economic Studies\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper develops a model to study how a default can affect the domestic economy and the government’s ability to provide liquidity. Banks that do not have good investment\r\nopportunities invest in public debt. After a default the government’s ability to credibly issue debt is undermined. A scarcer supply of public debt makes banks substitute\r\naway from government securities to investments in their less productive projects. A quantitative analysis of the model for Argentina can generate a deep and persistent\r\nfall in output post-default, which induces repayment incentives to sustain significant levels of external public debt. We provide empirical support for the model’s mechanism\r\nand use the model to analyze different policies that regulate banks’ holdings of public debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork in Progress\r\nMarket Efficiency and Welfare in the Interbank Market, with Thomar van Hees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
