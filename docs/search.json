Banks optimally choose their leverage and maturity structure in the presence of limited equity issuance, default risk, and partial deposit insurance. Long-maturity assets carry a premium because they expose banks to valuation losses when interest rates rise. To preserve their franchise value, banks with low net worth relative to risky assets take on less interest-rate risk, despite the presence of risk-shifting incentives associated with deposit insurance. Applying the model to the 2022–2023 monetary tightening, I show that a rapid increase in interest rates can generate large declines in asset prices and equity values even though banks have access to short-term assets that provide insurance against interest-rate risk. Under the lens of the model a substantial share of the losses in 2022 was predictable, whereas the losses in 2023 were largely unexpected. A shift toward long-term assets during a period of unusually low rates amplified the initial tightening, but a rebalancing toward shorter maturities dampened the transmission of later hikes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSovereign Debt, Domestic Banks and the Provision of Public Liquidity, with Diego Perez\r\n(Link to Paper), September 2025, Reject & Resubmit at Review of Economic Studies\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\r\nThis paper develops a model to study how a default can affect the domestic economy and the government’s ability to provide liquidity. Banks that do not have good investment\r\nopportunities invest in public debt. After a default the government’s ability to credibly issue debt is undermined. A scarcer supply of public debt makes banks substitute\r\naway from government securities to investments in their less productive projects. A quantitative analysis of the model for Argentina can generate a deep and persistent\r\nfall in output post-default, which induces repayment incentives to sustain significant levels of external public debt. We provide empirical support for the model’s mechanism\r\nand use the model to analyze different policies that regulate banks’ holdings of public debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterbank Trade, Liquidity Reallocation and Welfare in a Monetary Economy, with Thomar P. van Hees\r\n(Link to Paper), January 2026\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n\r\nWe study positive and normative implications of interbank trade in a monetary economy in which banks require liquidity to finance stochastic investment opportunities and meet bilaterally to offset liquidity imbalances once these opportunities are realized. Depending on the nominal interest rate, the economy exhibits abundant- or scarce-liquidity equilibria, with distinct implications for aggregate investment and monetary transmission. In terms of welfare, we show analytically that when interest rates are low, either full participation or a complete market shutdown is optimal, depending on the bargaining power of banks with investment opportunities. However, when bargaining power is sufficiently high and interest rates rise above a threshold, it becomes optimal to restrict—though not fully shut down—participation in the interbank market.\r\n\r\n\r\nWork in Progress\r\nMacroprudential Policy with Many Assets, with Jean C.
